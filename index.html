                <p>Bryan McCann is a proud graduate of Southern Methodist University and an aspiring full stack
                    developer. Bryan was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Ok and loves supporting the home team
                    Thunder! Bryan has been involved in sports his whole life, even winning the state title in the 100
                    meter dash in 2006. A feat made more impressive given that he broke his leg in September of 2005.
                    His success on the high school field and in the classroom provided him the opportunity to attend and
                    compete collegiately at SMU. He came in a started just 5 games into his freshman campaign. While his
                    sophmore and junior seasons were rough, because the Ponies only won one game each year, the senior
                    season ended with a BANG! The Mustangs got the chance to play in, and eventually win, the Hawaii
                    Bowl. It was the first time that SMU had been to a bowl game since the death penalty in the 80's!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After leaving SMU Bryan signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in April 2010. He
                    played just 9 games in his rookie season but still notched top honors as Pepsi Rookie of the Week,
                    NFC Defensive Player of the Week, and NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Throughout his playing
                    career, Bryan suited up for the Cowboys, Ravens, Raiders, Dolphins, Cardinals, and Redskins. Now he
                    is back at SMU pursuing his new passion of coding!
