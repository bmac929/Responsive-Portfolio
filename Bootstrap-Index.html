                        <p>Bryan McCann is a proud graduate of Southern Methodist University and an aspiring full stack
                            developer. Bryan was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Ok and loves supporting the home team
                            Thunder! Bryan has been involved in sports his whole life, even winning the state title in
                            the 100
                            meter dash in 2006. A feat made more impressive given that he broke his leg in September of
                            2005.
                            His success on the high school field and in the classroom provided him the opportunity to
                            attend and
                            compete collegiately at SMU. He came in a started just 5 games into his freshman campaign.
                            While his
                            sophmore and junior seasons were rough, because the Ponies only won one game each year, the
                            senior
                            season ended with a BANG! The Mustangs got the chance to play in, and eventually win, the
                            Hawaii
                            Bowl. It was the first time that SMU had been to a bowl game since the death penalty in the
                            80's!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p id="p">After leaving SMU Bryan signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in
                            April
                            2010. He
                            played just 9 games in his rookie season but still notched top honors as Pepsi Rookie of the
                            Week,
                            NFC Defensive Player of the Week, and NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Throughout his
                            playing
                            career, Bryan suited up for the Cowboys, Ravens, Raiders, Dolphins, Cardinals, and Redskins.
                            Now he
                            is back at SMU pursuing his new passion of coding!
